## Notes:

"I'm Professor Marfik, a researcher passionate for the ancient times. If you give me a hand with excavation here, I'll return the favor with your work. How's that sound?"

Archeologist enrolled in university, and an adventure-lover for as long as he remembers. An Earthling from Indianapolis, USA. Having vitality and toughness far from any ordinary person, he's a mischievous man in the prime of his life, who possesses both the composure and thinking power of a scholar, and the curiosity of a child.

He is interested in ancient civilizations from all sorts of planets, even the ones at the ends of the universe. It is said that if there is a place with rare ruins to explore, he will be there. On the other hand, he holds no interest whatsoever in the monetary value of the goods he digs out.
