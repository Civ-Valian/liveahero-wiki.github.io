## Notes:

"Yo, chief! How you doin'!? What? Too loud? I always talk like this! Anyway, let's go fishin' already! I'm itchin' for it!"

An alien fisherman who partakes in the inshore fishing industry and uses the rich sea of the ocean planet Muirauqa IV as a fishing ground. He is awfully emotional, easily moved to tears, rash, quick to lose temper; he's the true depiction of the Edoite man.

Confident in his vigorous stamina and muscles, he recklessly gets into fights, pokes his nose into other people's affairs, and is eager to get undressed. If you praise him for his physical strength or his good looks, he will be in a good mood. He lives in the same shipboard city and neighborhood as the carpenter Gorou. They're bad friends, but good drinking friends.
