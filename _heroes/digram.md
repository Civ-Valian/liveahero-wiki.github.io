## Notes

"I am exactly 34 seconds late, master. I apologize for not arriving to the meeting in time. In order to make up for the delay, let us make haste to our destination at once."

A living humanoid robot originating from the planet of machine life-forms, Tronesion.

He takes the position of a train conductor and driver of a company known as "The Galactic Railroad". From regional railroads to interplanetary routes; the company has a vast amount of transportation lines for passengers.

Being remarkably serene and earnest, he is very obedient to the rules and especially strict when it comes to time. Even mere seconds of tardiness are not tolerated.

Although his personality is more mechanical than that of the average robot, he is capable of showing emotions since he is a life-form who was born with them.

If he is given affection, he will meekly return the favor.
