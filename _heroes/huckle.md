## Notes:

"Hey now, don't overdo yourself over work. An operator must be ready at all times, you know? If something happens, it's my job to back you up."

The founder and current president of the company where the Protagonist works at. He is a former hero, nowadays taking command on the battlefield as a hero operator. Despite being an alien from another world, he is completely acclimatized to life on Earth.

Even though he is an adult with an easygoing personality and a high sense of responsibility, he can be a bit absent-minded. He is also a worldly-wise man who puts himself in a position as a mentor of the free-spirited Ryekie. In order to command a hero, one must possess a "particular ability" to a relatively high level.
