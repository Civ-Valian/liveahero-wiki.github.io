## Notes

"Ah... good work out there. If a fire breaks out, please leave it to me. I'm fine walking into the flames and such..."

A firefighter belonging to Orient City's fire department.

He's an alien from another world. His full name is Hull Furlong Hale.

His basal body temperature is higher than average because he originates from a planet that has a relatively hotter climate in comparision to Earth's.

Because he's resistant to high temperatures, he's helpful at rescuing lives from fires.

Usually shy and timid, he's a scaredy-cat that loves peace. However, when he transforms into the hero "Burn Striker", he drastically changes into a burningly brave personality.
