## Notes

"Hey, yer the backbone that keeps us all together, ya know. If ya weren't here, we wouldn't carry on and the scull'd reel. So come on now, puff up that chest."

He is a diligent man who works as a shipwright in charge of repairs and onboard construction in a shipboard city in the ocean planet of Muirauqa IV. Originating from a different planet, he eventually arrived to Muirauqa IV after wandering.

He is a lewd optimist with a sloppy personality, a heavy drinker, and an irresponsible carpenter that doesn't let go off his bottle of booze even at work. Despite this, he possesses firm arms and dexterous fingers. Contrary to expectations, he can easily assemble blueprints in his head and has the ability to accomplish precise and perfect architecture.
