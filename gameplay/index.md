## Combat system

### Easy-to-handle turn-based command battles!

The combat system is built on turn-based command battles.
The order of actions is dependent on each character’s agility order.

When the turn of the next ally character comes around, you can choose between “Skill activation” or “Wait”.

### Fight with your character’s various skills!

You can choose and use one of your character’s 3-4 skills.
Each skill has a set amount of “ViewPower” required to activate it.
VP increases with each character’s actions, and when you activate a skill, VP for each skill is consumed.

### Manage the order of actions and aim for cooperation!

By choosing “Wait” as an ally character’s action, you can change the order of actions at the end of the turn.
You can expand the range of strategies by choosing “Wait” as you make other characters act first or if you want to regulate VP, etcetera.

### ViewPower management is the key to victory!

VP is shared by both allies and enemies. Depending on the enemy, VP could be consumed to activate powerful skills.
If the enemy takes an action that consumes VP, the display of the enemy’s icon on the “Timeline” will change as a notice.
Make sure to consume VP before your enemy so you can block their skill activation and progress the battle in an advantageous way.

## Team formation

### Get in battle using the “Hero” and “Sidekick” tags!

Teams dispatched in battles are composed of up to 5 sets of Hero and Sidekick tags.
Heroes are the characters who stand in the front lines. During battle, combat will revolve around a Hero’s skills.
Sidekicks are characters that support the Hero they’re tagged with.
By setting a Sidekick to a Hero, you can use skills possessed by a Sidekick during battle. The Hero’s status can also be enhanced by the status of the Sidekick they’re paired with. 

### The composition order also comes into play!

During battle, the higher a character is positioned, the easier will be for the enemy to target them.
You can improve the survival rate of your team if you place characters with high HP and good defensive skills on the upper positions.

## Training system

### Train a Hero to improve their strenght!

You can raise a Hero’s “Level” and “Rank” by winning battles and using items on them.
As a Hero’s rank increases, their level cap will also increase, and their skills could also become stronger.
Furthermore, a Hero’s appearance will change when it reaches a certain rank.

### Training in tandem is also important!

There is a parameter called “Relation” between Heroes and Sidekicks that indicates the depth of their relationship.
When the Relation parameter increases its value by setting a tag of a Hero and a Sidekick, a Hero can receive “Equipment skills” from a Sidekick which have the effect of always activating.

## Business system

### Business is also an important job for a Hero!

When you set a Hero to depart for “Business”, they can gain experience points and obtain enhancing items by leaving them for a set amount of time. 
Heroes in Business can also participate in battles as usual, so you can train your Hero even faster if you put them to battle as well.

### Increase rewards with Business bonuses!

If you set a specific Hero to engage in Business, you may get additional bonuses to acquire special items.
There are various conditions to get a bonus, such as the selected Hero’s specific attribute or their rank.
